>Info About the Project

This is an Attendance Call Notifier webapp.
The Project uses Firebase services to store, read and write the attendance votes in the firestore database which is reflected whenever we log into the classroom.

For now the database is filled with quite small amount of data which will be managed and updated soon.

> Procedure

1. Go to the GrabAttend Webpage.
1.Use Your Classroom code:
for now the list of Classroom codes are:-
    *test
    *attendance
    *cs101
    *ma201
Rest of the classroom will be added soon for the realtime use.
1.Enter Your Name and then Join the Classroom
1. If the classroom code exist you will be pushed to the attendance voting page of the classroom code.
1.You can vote for the attandance call vote if it is time for attendance while also give voting reset request if you find the period is over.

As the limit i.e 15 votes is given for attendance call is crossed you will be given a desktop notification for Attendance Call.
